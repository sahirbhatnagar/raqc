## Main Idea {.emphasized}

<div class="red2", size="10">
Exploit the correlated nature of epigenetic signals, across both
marks and samples, for large-scale prediction of additional
datasets
</div>

## Matrix of Observed and Imputed Data

<div class="centered">
<img src="tablea.png" alt="tablea" style="width: 800px;"/>
</div>

## 1. Leverage other marks in same sample

<div class="centered">
<img src="cor1.png" alt="test" style="width: 850px;"/>
</div>

## 2. Leverage same mark in different sample

<div class="centered">
<img src="cor2.png" alt="test" style="width: 850px;"/>
</div>

## Types of data used to impute

<div class="centered">
<img src="used.png" alt="used" style="width: 500px;"/>
</div>


## Advantages of Imputation

> * Beneficial even if observed data is available
    + Combining information --> robust to experimental noise, confounders
    + Achieve a higher sequencing depth --> higher signal to noise ratio
> * Improve GWAS enrichments --> epigenomic maps as an unbiased approach for discovering disease-relevant tissues and cell types
> * Quality Control --> Are there discrepancies between imputed and observed datasets
> * Feature importance 
> * Chromatin state annotation

## Limitations

> -  If the presence of mark signal is highly specific to one or a
few samples, and it does not correlate with other marks mapped in the
sample or has a different correlation structure than in samples used for
training, then it would not be possible to accurately impute the mark at
those locations

> - When the target mark has been mapped in only a few
samples, the features pertaining to the same mark in other samples may
be less informative or more biased e.g. TFBS

> -  For tissue samples that reflect mixtures of
multiple cell types, our imputed maps will most likely reflect the same
mixture as the observed data, though deconvolution of mixed samples
is a potentially important direction for future work

## Tree-based Methods

* Involves _splitting_ the predictor space into simple regions
* Since the set of splitting rules used to segment the
predictor space can be summarized in a tree, these types of
approaches are known as decision-tree methods [@islr]

    - Years is the most important factor in 
    determining Salary
    - Given that a player is less 
    experienced, the number of Hits that 
    he made in the previous year seems 
    to play little role in his Salary
    - Among players who have been in 
    the major leagues for five or more years, 
    the number of Hits made in the previous 
    year does affect Salary

## More Details of Tree Building

> - The goal is to find boxes $R_1,\ldots, R_J$ that minimize the residual sum of squares give by

> - $$ \sum_{j=1}^J \sum_{i \in R_j} (y_i - \hat{y}_{Rj}) $$

> - $y_i$ is the subjects response, $\hat{y}_{Rj}$ is the mean in box $j$

> - Computationally infeasible to consider every single partition of the feature space into J boxes

> - Solution: take a top-down, greedy approach

> - Begins at the top, and never looks back
    
## Pros and Cons

> - Tree-based methods are simple and useful for interpretation
> - Highly sensity to the first split
> - Solution: Combining a large number of trees can often result in
dramatic improvements in prediction accuracy, at the
expense of some loss interpretation.
