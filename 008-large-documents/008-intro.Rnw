We are interested in studying the relationship between car size and accident injuries. We first analyze a dataset containing counts of car accidents classified by accident type, severity of accident, car weight and whether or not the driver was ejected from the car, each of which have two levels of classification. A second table from the same study, which contains more detailed information on each of these categories, is further analyzed. We model the data using Poisson, logistic and multinomial logistic regression. Results find an increased risk of severe accidents among those who drive standard size cars (OR:1.40[1.2,1.7]), rollover(5.15[4.4,6.1]) and are ejected from the car (2.8[2.3,3.4]). Contrary to what previous data has shown, standard size cars had a higher proportion of severe accidents compared to small sized cars. Our study shows that the type of accident is a strong indicator of the severity of accidents.

\section{Introduction}
Car size and weight are crucial to protecting people in crashes. Driver deaths in the U.S have been shown to decline fairly consistently as vehicle size increases \cite{iihs}. Among 1 to 3 year old cars registered in 2007, the overall death rate in mid-size cars is 23\% lower than in minicars. Due to growing environmental concerns in the past decade however, more automakers are reducing car weights to improve overall fuel economy. Environmentally conscious consumers are looking for smaller cars to reduce their ecological footprint. Increasing oil prices are another reason why market demand is shifting towards smaller, more fuel efficient vehicles. These statistics lead us to believe that we are safer in larger sizes cars which is a dilemma for the consumer as they try and get the best of both worlds i.e. a large enough car thats safe yet fuel efficient and good for the environment. We are interested in determining if there is a more complex relationship between the severity of accidents and car size. For example, if there are other factors such as the type of accident that can help predict accident severity. In section 2 we give a description of the datasets analyzed along with some plots describing our initial exploration. In section 3 we conduct a formal analysis using log linear and logistic models, followed by a discussion and conclusion in sections 4 and 5.
